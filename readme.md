# Demo Svelte App

**Basic setup for a [Svelte](https://svelte.technology) app with examples from the Svelte [guide](https://svelte.technology/guide) as demo.**

## Scripts

Development requires [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (alternatively you can use [npm](https://npmjs.org/)).

After installing dependencies using `yarn install` the following scripts are available:

`yarn ...` | Description
---|---
`build` | Builds app into `dist/`.
`dev`   | Starts dev server and file watchers (`start` and `watch`).
`start` | Starts dev server on [`http://localhost:7858`](http://localhost:7858) ("svlt" in T9).
`watch` | Watches and rebuilds app on file changes.
